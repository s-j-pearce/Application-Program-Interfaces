# Application-Program-Interfaces

### What is an API?
API or Application program interfaces is a form of software or a tool which helps developers. The API will allow the developer to have a list of preset operations as well as their descriptions as to what they do. API's do the hard parts so it helps in reducing the amount of code that the developers need to create. API's can also be used in order to control access to hardware devices and certain software functions that an application might not usually have permission to use - For this reason API's usually play a big role in security. In general, APIs define the rules that programmers need to follow in order to interact with a programming language, a software library, or any other software tool.

### Need for API's?
API's help developers save time by allowing them to have a set a preset commands which means the developer does not need to create as many lines of code. There are a lot of different API's for a lot of different situations. The release of the Iphone and how apps that followed through apple and android meant that companies needed to allow users access to information through the apps and not just through the internet. API's allow companies to produce raw data that other organisations can use to create a new look at the way the data is output. The data is simply provided with by the API which allows users to have virtually no limits on how that data is used and expressed. A huge benefit of any Web API is that they are built around the HTTP protocol meaning that nearly any programming language could be used to access them.

### Types of API's
#### Web service API's

#### SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)

#### XML-RPC

#### JSON-RPC

#### REST (Representational state transfer)

#### Library-based API's

#### Class-based API's (Object orientated) - a special type of library-based API

#### Function or routines in an OS

#### Object remoting API's

#### Hardware API's

#### Other developer products

### Relationship between an API and SDK
