### What is an API?
API or Application program interfaces is a form of software or a tool which helps developers. The API will allow the developer to have a list of preset operations as well as their descriptions as to what they do. API's do the hard parts so it helps in reducing the amount of code that the developers need to create. API's can also be used in order to control access to hardware devices and certain software functions that an application might not usually have permission to use - For this reason API's usually play a big role in security.
